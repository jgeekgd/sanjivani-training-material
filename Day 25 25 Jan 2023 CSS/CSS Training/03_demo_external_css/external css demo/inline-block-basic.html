    United States President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi
    WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI: United States President Joe Biden and Prime Minister
    Narendra Modi will have a virtual meeting on Monday ahead of the 2+2
    bilateral engagement between top foreign policy and defence officials of
    the two countries. The announcement was made simultaneously by both New
    Delhi and Washington on Sunday. TOI has learnt that the meeting was sought
    by the US side while the two countries were finalising the agenda for the
    2+2 and that it's meant to focus on a range of issues, and not just
    Ukraine. While the US said Biden will discuss the consequences of Russia's
    "brutal war" with Modi, India refrained from specifically mentioning the
    Ukraine issue in the official announcement.
