If a collection is iterable, then it can be iterated using an iterator (and consequently can be used in a for each loop.) 
The iterator is the actual object that will iterate through the collection.

Iterable present in java.á¸·ang package
Contains only one method iterator()

Iterator present in java.util package
Contains three method hasNext(), next(), remove()


An implementation of Iterable is one that provides an Iterator of itself:

public interface Iterable<T>
{
    Iterator<T> iterator();
}
An iterator is a simple way of allowing some to loop through a collection of data without assignment privileges (though with ability to remove).

public interface Iterator<E>
{
    boolean hasNext();
    E next();
    void remove();
}
