page implicit object:

In JSP, page is an implicit object of type Object class.This object is assigned to the reference of auto generated servlet class. It is written as:
Object page=this;
For using this object it must be cast to Servlet type.For example:
<% (HttpServlet)page.log("message"); %>
Since, it is of type Object it is less used because you can use this object directly in jsp.For example:
<% this.log("message"); %>
