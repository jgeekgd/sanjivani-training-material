The page directive defines attributes that apply to an entire JSP page.
Syntax of JSP page directive


<%@ page attribute="value" %>

Attributes of JSP page directive

1)import
The import attribute is used to import class,interface or all the members of a package.It is similar to import keyword in java class or interface.

2)contentType
The contentType attribute defines the MIME(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) type of the HTTP response.The default value is "text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1".

3)extends
The extends attribute defines the parent class that will be inherited by the generated servlet.It is rarely used.

4)info
This attribute simply sets the information of the JSP page which is retrieved later by using getServletInfo() method of Servlet interface.

5)buffer
The buffer attribute sets the buffer size in kilobytes to handle output generated by the JSP page.The default size of the buffer is 8Kb.

6)language
The language attribute specifies the scripting language used in the JSP page. The default value is "java".

7)isELIgnored
We can ignore the Expression Language (EL) in jsp by the isELIgnored attribute. By default its value is false i.e. Expression Language is enabled by default. We see Expression Language later.
<%@ page isELIgnored="true" %>//Now EL will be ignored

8)isThreadSafe
Servlet and JSP both are multithreaded.If you want to control this behaviour of JSP page, you can use isThreadSafe attribute of page directive.The value of isThreadSafe value is true.If you make it false, the web container will serialize the multiple requests, i.e. it will wait until the JSP finishes responding to a request before passing another request to it.If you make the value of isThreadSafe attribute like:
<%@ page isThreadSafe="false" %>
The web container in such a case, will generate the servlet as:
public class SimplePage_jsp extends HttpJspBase 
  implements SingleThreadModel{
.......
}

9)errorPage
The errorPage attribute is used to define the error page, if exception occurs in the current page, it will be redirected to the error page.


10)isErrorPage
The isErrorPage attribute is used to declare that the current page is the error page.
Note: The exception object can only be used in the error page


11)pageEncoding
To set encoding used in the page

12)autoFlush
Whether the buffered output should be flushed automatically when the buffer is full. If set to true (the default value), the buffer will be flushed. If set to false, an exception will be raised when the buffer overflows. You cannot set autoFlush to false when buffer is set to none.

13)session
Whether the client must join an HTTP session in order to use the JSP page. If the value is true, the session object refers to the current or new session.
If the value is false, you cannot use the session object or a <jsp:useBean> element with scope=session in the JSP page. Either of these usages would cause a translation-time error.
The default value is true.
