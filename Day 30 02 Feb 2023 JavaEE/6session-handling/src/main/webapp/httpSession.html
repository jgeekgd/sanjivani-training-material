		HttpSession API: <br> Session Management API is built on top of
		above methods for session tracking. Some of the major disadvantages of
		all the above methods are: Most of the time we don't want to only
		track the session, we have to store some data into the session that we
		can use in future requests. This will require a lot of effort if we
		try to implement this. All the above methods are not complete in
		themselves, all of them won't work in a particular scenario. So we
		need a solution that can utilize these methods of session tracking to
		provide session management in all cases. That's why we need Session
		Management API and J2EE Servlet technology comes with session
		management API that we can use.
