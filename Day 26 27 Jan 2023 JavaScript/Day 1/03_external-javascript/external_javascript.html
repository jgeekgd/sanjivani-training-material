<script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>

<body style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">
  <p>
    Why do I get an error or Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'innerHTML'
    of null?
    <br />
    The browser always loads the entire HTML DOM from top to bottom. Any
    JavaScript code written inside the script tags (present in head section of
    your HTML file) gets executed by the browser rendering engine even before
    your whole DOM (various HTML element tags present within body tag) is
    loaded. The scripts present in head tag are trying to access an element
    having id hello even before it has actually been rendered in the DOM. So
    obviously, JavaScript failed to see the element and hence you end up seeing
    the null reference error.

  <div id="currentDateTime">
    <script type="text/javascript">
      what();
      function what() {
        document.getElementById("currentDateTime").innerHTML = getDateTime();
      }
    </script>
  </div>
</body>
