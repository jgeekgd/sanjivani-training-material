      You can use strict mode in all your programs. It helps you to write
      cleaner code, like preventing you from using undeclared variables. "use
      strict" is just a string, so IE 9 will not throw an error even if it does
      not understand it.
    </p>
    <h2>With "use strict":</h2>
    <h3>Using a variable without declaring it, is not allowed.</h3>

    <p>Activate debugging in your browser (F12) to see the error report.</p>

    <script>
      "use strict";
      x = 3.14; // This will cause an error (x is not defined).
    </script>
