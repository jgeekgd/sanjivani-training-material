 * Java Program to Demonstrate Nested class Where Error is thrown
 * 
 * Note:  We can not have a static method in a nested inner class because an inner class is
 * implicitly associated with an object of its outer class so it cannot define any static method for itself.
 * For example, the following program doesnâ€™t compile. 
 * 
 * But Since JAVA Version 16 we can have static members in our inner class also.

 * Eclipse Right Click Run As- Java Application You See Two Options
